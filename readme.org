* Emacs Sandbox

  A simple bash script to help quickly create and launch a minimal Emacs sandbox.

** Installation

   Everything is contained within the one =emacs-sandbox.sh= file, so somehow get that into your PATH.

   One way to do that would be to:

   1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
   2. Create a Symlink from =emacs-sandbox.sh= to a folder already in your path.


   Because I already have =~/bin= in my PATH, those commands might look like:

   #+begin_src shell
     mkdir -p ~/src && cd ~/src
     git clone https://github.com/bgturner/emacs-sandbox.git
     ln -s ~/src/emacs-sandbox/emacs-sandbox.sh ~/bin/emacs-sandbox.sh
   #+end_src

** Usage

   The script defaults to an environment that's named =sandbox= though you can specify a different name using the =-n= flag.

   When you run this script for the first time, it will create a new folder based on the name of the environment you give it and will write various pieces of elisp to the =init.el= file for that environment.

   If this script finds an existing sandbox, no configuration is written and instead an Emacs instance using that configuration is launched.

   You can find up-to-date usage with the =-h= flag:

   #+begin_example
     â˜… main src/emacs-sandbox % emacs-sandbox.sh -h
     Usage: emacs-sandbox.sh [-h|[-n name]|[-i config_name]]
	    h    Print this help.
	    n    Name of the environment to load.
	    i    Include a configuration. Available configurations are:
		 - melpa - Include configuration for melpa.
		 - straight - Include configuration for straight.
		 - minimal-ui - Config for a simpler UI.
		 - ivy - Config for Ivy completion framework.
		 - evil - Config for Evil mode.

     Examples:
	     emacs-sandbox.sh -i straight -i evil
	     # Creates the default 'sandbox' environment with 'straight'
	     # and 'evil' configuration.

	     emacs-sandbox.sh -n super-secret -i melpa -i straight -i ivy
	     # Creates the named 'super-secret' environment with 'melpa'
	     # 'straight' and 'ivy' configuration.

   #+end_example
